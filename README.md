# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn (cancel their subscription) for a telecommunications company using machine learning models. The dataset used is the publicly available **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from Kaggle.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Data preprocessing: encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features
- Machine Learning models:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
- Model evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- Discussion on AI ethics and post-deployment strategies
